wrapstuff
=========

The `wrapstuff` package provides another implementation of text wrapping.
Its implementation benefits from the paragraph hooks available since
LaTeX 2021-06-01.

Basic Usage
-----------
The package only provides a user environment `wrapstuff`.
```LaTeX
\begin{wrapstuff}[<options>]
  <wrapping stuff>
\end{wrapstuff}
<main text>
```
You can read the package manual (in Chinese) for some explanations.

Contributing
------------
The package is still highly experimental and not fully tested.
[Issues](https://github.com/qinglee/wrapstuff/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/qinglee/wrapstuff/pulls)
are always welcome.
